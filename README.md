  <h1>Seeing More, Saying More: Lightweight Language Experts are Dynamic Video Token Compressors</h1>

## LangDC Overview 

Current large video-language models face efficiency issues due to processing massive visual tokens. Existing fixed-ratio token compression ignores varying semantic density across video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length.

## Contributions 
1) We propose LangDC, a novel language-aware token compression strategy. Using soft language tokens for visual representation, it adaptively adjusts compression ratios, improving token utilization over fixed-ratio techniques. 

2) We propose semantic density-aware supervision for the token compressors. By explicitly providing reconstruction targets for token compression, we enable the derivation of a more compact feature set that is not only aware of information richness but also preserves key visual cues. 

3) Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces FLOPs by 49\% relative to the strong baseline VideoGPT+, while maintaining competitive performance. Additional qualitative results show adaptive compression based on video clip semantic density.
